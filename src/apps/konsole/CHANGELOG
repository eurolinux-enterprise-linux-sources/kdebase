KDE 4.1
==========================

New Features:
	- BUG 152072 - Add 'Copy Input To...' feature which allows the output of the current 
	  session to be copied to all of or a subset of the running sessions.
	- BUG 75653 - Tabs may be dragged and dropped between windows and containers.
	- Text anti-aliasing can be turned off via the 'Smooth Fonts' option in the profile editor
	- Make mouse-wheel scrolling work in "less" and other terminal applications which don't
	understand mouse commands.
	- BUG 157256 - The session number can be displayed in tab titles using the %# marker
	- Added option to specify whether new sessions start in the same directory as the current
	session.
	- Option to enable bi-directional text rendering in a profile
	- BUG 158235 - Support Xterm's clear history escape sequence 
	- New color scheme, 'Dark Pastels' is a softer alternative to Linux colors or Black on white.

Minor changes:
	- Limit tab name length to prevent a single tab from taking up the entire tab bar.
	- Scroll the terminal continually when the mouse is held down and moved outside the display
	(like a text document)
	- Use KDE's shortcut editor to input profile shortcuts
	- Transparency is enabled by default and does not require the '--enable-transparency' flag
	to be passed to Konsole on startup.  A new '--notransparency' option is available to turn
	transparency off.

Fixes:
	- Fix embedded terminal not gaining focus when shown in Dolphin
	- Update scrolling optimisations to work with Qt 4.4
	- BUG 159261 - Set both local and remote tab titles when manually renaming a tab
	- BUG 152781 - Trailing whitespace at end of selection not copied
	- BUG 155801 - 	Support for setting background and foreground colors of the current session 
					using the xtermcontrol tool
	- BUG 158513 - 	Re-implement --noclose command-line option.  Add -hold as a synonym for
					Xterm compatibility
	- BUG 120322 - 	Display a warning and do not close the terminal immediately if the session
					cannot be started (eg. because the program is missing).  Try to fall back
					to $SHELL and then /bin/sh if the program cannot be found
	- BUG 159657 -  Safer shutdown sequence.  Fixes crash which appeared after the changeover
					to Qt 4.4
	- BUG 159096 -  'Find Next'/'Find Previous' jumped to the wrong line number if the output
					contained wrapped lines.
	- BUG 156654 - 	Force Left-To-Right text layout in the terminal display otherwise it 
					becomes unusable on RTL desktops
	- BUG 157667 - 	Disabled several actions in the KPart which are unused to prevent
					clashes with shortcuts in Yakuake etc.
	- Allow selection of trailing new-line character at end of selection for consistency with
	KDE 3.5
	- Respect KDE color scheme in transparency warning box 
	- Update tab colors when color scheme is changed
	- BUG 160422 - Fix calculation of initial size of window.  Default to 80 characters width.
	- Do not re-use an existing Konsole process when started from a terminal.  This ensures that
	  the environment from the terminal is inherited by the new terminal window.
