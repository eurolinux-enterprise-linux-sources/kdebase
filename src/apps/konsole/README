Konsole - KDE's Terminal Emulator
==================================

Konsole is a terminal program for KDE.

As well as being a standalone program, it is also used by other KDE programs such as the Kate editor
and KDevelop development environment to provide easy access to a terminal window. 

Up-to-date information about the latest releases can be found on Konsole's website
at http://konsole.kde.org

Konsole's features and usage are explained and illustrated in the Konsole handbook,
which can be accessed by browsing to "help:/konsole" in Konqueror.
