About kdebase
-------------
kdebase is the second mandatory package (besides kdelibs) for the K Desktop
Environment. Here we have various applications and infrastructure files and
libraries. Here is an overview of the directories:

== WARNING THIS OVERVIEW IS OLD; things have been separated into submodules nowadays ==

* doc
    XML formatted documentation files for the apps

* drkonqi
    If ever an app crashes (heaven forbid!) then Dr.Konqi will be so kind
    and make a stack trace. This is a great help for the developers to fix
    the bug.

* kappfinder
    Searches for non-KDE applications, e.g. Acrobat Reader (tm) and installs
    those apps under the K start button.

* kcheckpass
    Small program to enter and check passwords, to be used by other
    programs.

* kcontrol
    The KDE Control Center allows you to tweak the KDE settings.

    Allows you to specify which debug messages you want to see.

* kdesu
    A graphical front end to "su".

* kdialog
    Allows to display menu boxes from shell scripts.

* kdm
    Replacement for XDM, for those people that like graphical logins.

    File find utility (standalone and in Konqueror's file manager).

* khelpcenter
    Used to to read all great documentation about KDE, unix man pages,
    info pages etc.

* khotkeys
    Intercepts keys and can call applications.

* kioslave
    Infrastructure that helps make every application internet enabled
    e.g. to directly save a file to ftp://place.org/dir/file.txt

* kscreensaver
    The KDE screensaver environment and some basic screensavers. More
    of them are in the kdeartwork package.

    A KDE frontend for passwd. Also contains the "Password & User Information" KCM.

    Some libraries needed by Konqueror.

* nsplugins
    Together with OSF/Motif or Lesstif allows you to use Netscape (tm)
    plugins in Konqueror.

* pics
    Various icons and wallpapers.

Common Mistakes
---------------
IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIRS as the directory where KDE is
installed.  Please set this in your login file. KDEDIR is deprecated starting
with KDE 4. Instead use KDEDIRS, which can also hold a list of directories.

If XPM support wasn't configured, it may be that configure has no idea where
your XPM libraries are.  If so, set XPM_INCLUDE and XPM_LDFLAGS to the paths
where configure should look for XPM.  But if you haven't installed XPM or it
didn't come with your system, that's no problem.  You will only miss a few
screensavers.  The same thing applies with OPENGL support.  Here you have to
set GL_INCLUDE and GL_LDFLAGS.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at
ftp://ftp.trolltech.com and download the latest Qt 4.x.x release, at least Qt 4.4.0.

Be advised, if you're using FreeBSD, then please do not use the Qt port that
comes along with it.

Configuring
-----------

KDE 4 is built using CMake (http://www.cmake.org), version 2.4.5 is the minimum
required version. This means there is no configure-script anymore, but you
need to run cmake.
Before building kdebase, you need to build and install kdepimlibs, this is 
new compared to KDE < 4.
Most of the options which were supported by the "old" configure script
are already also supported with the new buildsystem. To adjust these options,
use ccmake, there you can see them all. They have been slightly renamed
compared to the configure-options:

These are the installation directories, by default they are all
located beneath /usr/local, but you can adjust each of them individually.

 CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR       - the config file install dir
 DATA_INSTALL_DIR         - the parent directory where applications can install their data
 HTML_INSTALL_DIR         - the HTML install dir for documentation
 ICON_INSTALL_DIR         - the icon install dir (default prefix/share/icons/)
 INFO_INSTALL_DIR         - the kde info install dir (default prefix/info)
 KCFG_INSTALL_DIR         - the install dir for kconfig files
 LIB_INSTALL_DIR          - the subdirectory relative to the install prefix where libraries will b
 LOCALE_INSTALL_DIR       - the install dir for translations
 MAN_INSTALL_DIR          - the kde man page install dir (default prefix/man/)
 MIME_INSTALL_DIR         - the install dir for the mimetype desktop files
 PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR       - the subdirectory relative to the install prefix where plugins will be
 SERVICES_INSTALL_DIR     - the install dir for service (desktop, protocol, ...) files
 SERVICETYPES_INSTALL_DIR - the install dir for servicestypes desktop files
 SOUND_INSTALL_DIR        - the install dir for sound files
 TEMPLATES_INSTALL_DIR    - the install dir for templates (Create new file...)
 WALLPAPER_INSTALL_DIR    - the install dir for wallpapers
 KCONF_UPDATE_INSTALL_DIR - the kconf_update install dir
 XDG_APPS_INSTALL_DIR     - the XDG apps dir
 XDG_DIRECTORY_INSTALL_DIR- the XDG directory
 SYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR      - The kde sysconfig install dir
 AUTOSTART_INSTALL_DIR    - The install dir for autostart files 

CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH: set it to TRUE to disable RPATH completely
KDE4_USE_ALWAYS_FULL_RPATH: set it to TRUE to use the full RPATH everywhere

Use ccmake to see all available settings.

Debugging
---------
You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs. 
To get another build of KDE, you have to adjust the CMake variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
The following build types are supported:

"RELWITHDEBINFO" - optimized and debug info
"RELEASE"        - optimized
"DEBUG"          - optimizied, debug info, some optimizations disabled
"DEBUGFULL"      - more debug info, no optimizations
"PROFILE"        - full debug, coverage and profile info

If you experience problems and want to
report problems to the KDE Bugs database, it is recommended to recompile
with this switch enabled to make the backtraces more verbose (and thus
giving the developer more information about the cause of the bug).


Removal/Uninstallation
----------------------
You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely, and is depreciated. On a system
where KDEDIRS is specific to KDE (i.e. not /usr) and contains only a single
directory, rm -rf $KDEDIRS does it as well.


More Info
---------
If your system supports PAM (Plugable Authentication Modules), please see
the README.pam file in the workspace directory for more information about
using KDE with PAM.

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you would like to find out
more about a specific application included in kdebase.

More FAQs on http://www.kde.org/info/faq.html

If you have problems compiling and installing this package, please check the
kde-devel@kde.org mailing list archive (see http://lists.kde.org) to see if
somebody had a similar problem already. If not, try posting a message to
the list with detailed information about the compile problem.

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
